# Call Center App
**Objective:** This is a simple, hypothetical call center app. The goal was to learn how to connect a database with Python and create a basic GUI.  
**Technologies:** Python, SQL  
**Setup:** Requires local database configuration. Ensure you set up and connect to your local database before running the application.

# H2O Classification & Regression
**Objective:** Uses H2O.ai's external API for fast data processing and modeling, providing a bit of automation in building predictive models.  
**Technologies:** Python, H2O.ai, Jupyter Notebook  
**Setup:** Install H2O.ai and its dependencies. Initialize H2O in your script and load your dataset to begin modeling.

# Neural Network Classification
**Objective:** Implements neural networks to classify datasets effectively.  
**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Jupyter Notebook

# Scikit-learn Regression
**Objective:** Runs regression models with scikit-learn to predict numbers and visualize data.  
**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  
**Setup:** Install scikit-learn and other necessary libraries. Load your dataset, select appropriate features, and apply regression models to make predictions.
